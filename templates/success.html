    <h2>Success! Check your Spotify playlists.</h2>
    <p>Please check and scan the 3 new playlists that were created at the top of 'Your Library' within Spotify.
        They should be sorted from high to low energy. Once you're done listening, please click on the 'Go to Survey'
        button below to fill out a short survey. You can also start over with the 'Try Again' button. You'll get
        slightly different results.</p>
